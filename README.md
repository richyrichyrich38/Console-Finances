# Console-Finances

## Description

We had to create Javascript code that ran through an already existing data array and extract the following which would present neatly within the console when the page is loaded-

- total months
- total numeric value
- average change
- greatest profit increase and month it occured
- greatest profit decrease and the month that it occured

To say I found this incredibly challenging would be an understatement. The code to complete the project is laid out as follows-

- global variables
- for loop to access and loop through the finances array
- created an array that stores just the numeric values
- if statement that cycles through array to find the highest profit increase adding highest to itself as it goes and attributes that correlating month to the previously assigned array
- if statement that cycles through array to find the largest profit decrease adding lowest to itself as it goes and attributes that correlating month to the previously assigned array
- calculates the accumulated change and adds it to netChange array ready for / with no of months
- total numeric value of finances is added to total array
- total months is obtained using the .length property and the average change is obtained by / the net change by no of months
- console logged the outputs in the fashion requested and used template literals to output the data
